## How ClearCase Works

ClearCase is a centralized version control system that uses a unique "view-based" architecture. Think of it as a virtual file system that sits on top of your regular file system.

**Core Architecture:**
- **VOB (Versioned Object Base)**: The central repository that stores all versions of files, directories, and metadata
- **Views**: Virtual workspaces that present a specific configuration of files from the VOB
- **Config Spec**: A set of rules that defines which versions of files your view should show
- **Elements**: Files and directories under version control

**Basic Workflow:**
1. **Create a view** - Set up your workspace with a config spec
2. **Check out** - Lock a file for editing (prevents others from modifying it)
3. **Edit** - Make your changes to the checked-out file
4. **Check in** - Save your changes back to the VOB with a comment
5. **Update view** - Refresh to see others' changes

**Key Terminology:**
- **Branch**: A line of development for a file or directory
- **Label**: A snapshot marker applied to specific versions
- **Baseline**: A recommended configuration of file versions
- **Merge**: Combining changes from different branches
- **Hijack**: Modifying a file without checking it out (discouraged)

## ClearCase vs Git Comparison

| ClearCase Concept | Git Equivalent | Notes |
|------------------|----------------|-------|
| VOB | Remote Repository | Central storage |
| View | Working Directory + Branch | Local workspace |
| Config Spec | Branch/Tag checkout | Defines what you see |
| Check out/Check in | Add/Commit + Push | Making changes |
| Element | Tracked file | File under version control |
| Label | Tag | Marking specific versions |
| Branch | Branch | Line of development |
| Baseline | Release tag/branch | Stable configuration |

**Key Differences:**
- **ClearCase**: Centralized, file-locking, view-based
- **Git**: Distributed, merge-based, repository-based

## Migration Strategy with Minimum Impact

**Phase 1: Parallel Setup**
1. **Export history**: Use tools like `git-cc` or `clearcase-to-git` to convert VOB history
2. **Mirror structure**: Maintain same directory layout and branching strategy initially
3. **Dual operation**: Run both systems temporarily for validation

**Phase 2: Workflow Translation**
```bash
# ClearCase workflow
cleartool co filename
# edit file
cleartool ci filename

# Git equivalent
git pull                    # Update first
# edit file
git add filename
git commit -m "message"
git push
```

**Phase 3: Process Adaptation**
- **Replace check-out/check-in** with **pull/add/commit/push**
- **Convert config specs** to **branch switching**: `git checkout branch-name`
- **Replace labels** with **tags**: `git tag -a v1.0 -m "Release 1.0"`
- **Convert baselines** to **release branches** or **tags**

**Minimizing Impact:**
1. **Keep familiar branching names** (main, dev, feature branches)
2. **Maintain similar access controls** using Git hosting platforms
3. **Preserve commit history** during migration
4. **Create Git aliases** for common ClearCase commands:
   ```bash
   git config alias.co checkout
   git config alias.ci commit
   ```
5. **Use Git hooks** to enforce similar policies (commit message formats, code reviews)

**Training Focus:**
- Emphasize that Git is **distributed** (everyone has full history)
- **No file locking** - conflicts resolved through merging
- **Commit early, commit often** philosophy vs ClearCase's heavier check-in process
- **Branching is lightweight** - encourage feature branches

The key is translating ClearCase's centralized, file-centric mindset to Git's distributed, changeset-centric approach while maintaining familiar terminology and processes where possible.
