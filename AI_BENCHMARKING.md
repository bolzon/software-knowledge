# AI Benchmarking

Benchmarking the performance of an AI system, especially one written in Python with CUDA, NVIDIA tools like TensorRT, and running on a GPU with 12GB of memory inside a containerized environment (local or Kubernetes), requires a systematic approach. Below, I’ll outline the most important metrics to extract and provide guidance on how to evaluate performance, considering optimal integration with TensorRT and GPU acceleration.

---

### Key Metrics to Extract
1. **Inference Latency**
   - **Definition**: Time taken to process a single input (e.g., one image, one batch of data) and produce an output.
   - **Why it matters**: Critical for real-time applications.
   - **How to measure**: Use Python’s `time` module or a high-precision timer (e.g., `torch.cuda.Event` for PyTorch) to record the time from input submission to output generation. Average over multiple runs (e.g., 1000 inferences) to account for variability.
   - **Target**: Minimize latency while maintaining accuracy.

2. **Throughput**
   - **Definition**: Number of inferences per second (or inputs processed per unit time).
   - **Why it matters**: Indicates scalability and efficiency for batch processing or high-load scenarios.
   - **How to measure**: Process a large dataset (e.g., 10,000 samples) and divide the total number of samples by the elapsed time. Vary batch sizes to find the throughput sweet spot.
   - **Target**: Maximize throughput without exhausting GPU memory (12GB limit).

3. **GPU Memory Utilization**
   - **Definition**: Amount of GPU memory consumed during inference.
   - **Why it matters**: Ensures the model fits within the 12GB constraint and leaves room for other processes in a containerized environment.
   - **How to measure**: Use NVIDIA’s `nvidia-smi` command or Python libraries like `pynvml` to monitor memory usage during runtime.
   - **Target**: Stay below 12GB (e.g., aim for 80-90% utilization max) to avoid out-of-memory errors.

4. **Model Accuracy**
   - **Definition**: Quality of the AI model’s predictions (e.g., precision, recall, F1 score, etc.).
   - **Why it matters**: Performance isn’t just speed—accuracy must align with application requirements.
   - **How to measure**: Compare model outputs against a ground-truth validation dataset. Use standard metrics depending on the task (e.g., classification, regression).
   - **Target**: Ensure TensorRT optimizations (e.g., FP16 or INT8 precision) don’t degrade accuracy beyond an acceptable threshold.

5. **Startup Time**
   - **Definition**: Time to initialize the model and load it into GPU memory.
   - **Why it matters**: Important for containerized environments (e.g., Kubernetes), where pods may restart frequently.
   - **How to measure**: Record the time from container startup to when the model is ready for inference (e.g., after TensorRT engine десerialization).
   - **Target**: Minimize startup overhead, especially in dynamic scaling scenarios.

6. **Power Consumption**
   - **Definition**: GPU power draw during inference.
   - **Why it matters**: Relevant for energy-efficient deployments or cost optimization in cloud/Kubernetes clusters.
   - **How to measure**: Use `nvidia-smi` to monitor power usage (in watts) during inference.
   - **Target**: Optimize for lower power draw if energy efficiency is a priority.

7. **CPU and I/O Overhead**
   - **Definition**: Resource usage outside the GPU (e.g., data preprocessing on CPU, disk/network I/O).
   - **Why it matters**: In a container, CPU and I/O bottlenecks can negate GPU performance gains.
   - **How to measure**: Use Python’s `psutil` to track CPU usage and I/O wait times, or profile with tools like `cProfile`.
   - **Target**: Minimize non-GPU overhead to keep the pipeline GPU-bound.

8. **Batch Size Scalability**
   - **Definition**: How performance (latency/throughput) changes with different batch sizes.
   - **Why it matters**: Determines optimal batch size for your 12GB GPU memory constraint.
   - **How to measure**: Run inference with increasing batch sizes (e.g., 1, 4, 8, 16, 32) and plot latency/throughput vs. batch size until memory is exhausted.
   - **Target**: Identify the batch size that maximizes throughput without exceeding memory limits.

### How to Evaluate Performance with TensorRT Integration
Since your AI model leverages TensorRT for GPU acceleration, performance evaluation must account for its optimizations (e.g., mixed precision, layer fusion, kernel autotuning). Here’s a step-by-step approach:

1. **Set Up a Benchmarking Environment**
   - Use a consistent container image (e.g., NVIDIA’s `nvcr.io/nvidia/tensorrt` Docker image) with Python, CUDA, and TensorRT installed.
   - Ensure the GPU driver and CUDA versions match TensorRT requirements.
   - Isolate the container (local or Kubernetes) to avoid resource contention.

2. **Optimize the Model with TensorRT**
   - Convert your model (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow) to ONNX format, then build a TensorRT engine:
     ```python
     import tensorrt as trt
     import numpy as np
     import pycuda.driver as cuda
     import pycuda.autoinit

     # Load ONNX model and create TensorRT logger
     TRT_LOGGER = trt.Logger(trt.Logger.WARNING)
     with open("model.onnx", "rb") as f, trt.Builder(TRT_LOGGER) as builder:
         network = builder.create_network(1 << int(trt.NetworkDefinitionCreationFlag.EXPLICIT_BATCH))
         parser = trt.OnnxParser(network, TRT_LOGGER)
         parser.parse(f.read())
         builder.max_batch_size = 32  # Adjust based on testing
         builder.max_workspace_size = 1 << 30  # 1GB workspace
         builder.fp16_mode = True  # Enable FP16 for speedup
         engine = builder.build_cuda_engine(network)
     ```
   - Test FP16 or INT8 precision modes to reduce latency/memory usage, but validate accuracy.

3. **Profile Inference**
   - Use TensorRT’s Python API or NVIDIA’s `trtexec` tool for low-level profiling:
     ```bash
     trtexec --onnx=model.onnx --fp16 --shapes=input:1x3x224x224 --threads
     ```
   - Extract latency, throughput, and memory usage directly from `trtexec` output.

4. **Implement a Benchmarking Script**
   - Example in Python with PyTorch and TensorRT:
     ```python
     import time
     import torch
     import numpy as np
     from pynvml import nvmlInit, nvmlDeviceGetHandleByIndex, nvmlDeviceGetMemoryInfo

     # Dummy input (adjust shape to your model)
     batch_size = 8
     input_data = torch.randn(batch_size, 3, 224, 224).cuda()

     # Load TensorRT engine (assumed pre-built)
     with open("engine.trt", "rb") as f:
         runtime = trt.Runtime(TRT_LOGGER)
         engine = runtime.deserialize_cuda_engine(f.read())

     # Warm-up run
     context = engine.create_execution_context()
     for _ in range(10):
         context.execute(batch_size, [input_data.data_ptr()])

     # Measure latency and throughput
     num_runs = 1000
     start = time.time()
     for _ in range(num_runs):
         context.execute(batch_size, [input_data.data_ptr()])
     torch.cuda.synchronize()  # Ensure GPU finishes
     latency = (time.time() - start) / num_runs * 1000  # ms
     throughput = batch_size * num_runs / (time.time() - start)

     # Memory usage
     nvmlInit()
     handle = nvmlDeviceGetHandleByIndex(0)
     mem_info = nvmlDeviceGetMemoryInfo(handle)
     mem_used = mem_info.used / 1024**2  # MB

     print(f"Latency: {latency:.2f} ms")
     print(f"Throughput: {throughput:.2f} inferences/sec")
     print(f"GPU Memory Used: {mem_used:.2f} MB")
     ```

5. **Evaluate in Target Environment**
   - **Local Machine**: Run the script directly, ensuring no other GPU processes interfere.
   - **Kubernetes**: Deploy the container with resource limits (e.g., `resources: { limits: { nvidia.com/gpu: 1 } }` in the pod spec). Use tools like Prometheus + NVIDIA GPU exporter to monitor metrics in real time.

6. **Analyze Results**
   - Compare latency/throughput across batch sizes and precision modes (FP32 vs. FP16 vs. INT8).
   - Check memory usage against the 12GB limit—adjust batch size or model complexity if needed.
   - Validate accuracy post-TensorRT optimization against the original model.
   - Identify bottlenecks (e.g., CPU preprocessing, data loading) using profiling tools like NVIDIA Nsight Systems or Python’s `line_profiler`.

### Additional Considerations
- **Reproducibility**: Use a fixed random seed and consistent input data for fair comparisons.
- **Cold vs. Warm Starts**: Measure both cold-start (initial load) and warm-start (cached engine) performance.
- **Scalability**: In Kubernetes, test how performance scales with multiple replicas/pods sharing GPU resources.
- **Hardware-Specific Tuning**: Leverage TensorRT’s kernel autotuning for your GPU (e.g., NVIDIA A100, RTX 3090) to optimize layer execution.

By focusing on these metrics and evaluation steps, you’ll get a comprehensive view of your AI system’s performance, balancing speed, resource usage, and accuracy in a GPU-accelerated, containerized setup. Let me know if you need help with specific tools or code tweaks!
